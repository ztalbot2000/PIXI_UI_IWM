# PIXI_Ui_IWM - PIXI UI Elements made Really Easy.

<BR><BR>
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **PIXI UI** is a set of UI Elements based on the great work at IWM. (Institute Wissensmedien). This main set of UI Elements have been updated for PIXI V5 and written in Typescript.  The base code was extremely well written, but the change to Typescript did find a few issues.

  The original source had a few features that had impracticle third party requirements which were great for educational purposes, but not distributable. otherwise there ws no licensed attached.  This version does not have any third party requirements and is fully usuable under the MIT License.

## Support
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked on this part of the tool, not to just create a set of UI Elements, but to be used for another purpose.  If you find issues and can fix them, send me a pull request.  Otherwise, I have other things to do.

## Extra Features
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond UI Elementshts, there are a few build tools made available.
### 1) Webpack.
 Webpack is used as the main build tool. 

### 2) Webpack DevServer
 The Webpack DevServer plugin is used to illustrate the behaviour of all UI Elements.

### 3) TSC
  All elements pass Typescript type checking.

### 3) Mocha Unit Testing
  Many of the objects are unit tested.  Included in the testing is compatability between the old UI source objects and the new Typescript UI objects.
