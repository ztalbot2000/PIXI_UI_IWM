   <h1>Popover</h1>
   <p>
      Add small overlay content, like those found in iOS, to any element for housing secondary information.

      let popover1 = new PIXI.UI.Popover({title: "Popover title", text: "This is the popover text.", x: 150, y: 130})
      app.scene.addChild(popover1)

      let popover2 = new PIXI.UI.Popover({text: "This is another popover text. It has more words than the first one, some line breaks, \n\nbut no title :-(", x: 50, y: 230, placement: "right", width: 180})
      app.scene.addChild(popover2)

      let popover3 = new PIXI.UI.Popover({title: "Popover title 3. This title has many words but the Popover has no text...", x: 650, y: 70, placement: "left"})
      app.scene.addChild(popover3)

      const text4 = `
